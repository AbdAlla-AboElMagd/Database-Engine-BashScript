Project Title:

Bash Script-Based Database Management System

Objective:

To develop a functional database management system (DBMS) in Bash that supports basic database operations like creating, listing, connecting to, and deleting databases, as well as managing tables within those databases.

Instructions:

1. General Requirements:

    Write all scripts using Bash scripting.
    Use clear and user-friendly prompts for interaction.
    Follow modular programming principles:
        A main script (db.sh) to handle database-level operations.
        A separate script (table.sh) to handle table-level operations.

2. Functional Requirements:
Database Management (db.sh):

    Create Database:
        Prompt the user to enter a name for the database.
        Validate the name to avoid special characters or numbers at the start.
        Create a folder for the database and ensure appropriate permissions.
    List Databases:
        Display all available databases in the system.
    Connect to Database:
        Allow the user to connect to an existing database.
        Once connected, transfer control to the table.sh script for table operations.
    Delete Database:
        Prompt the user for confirmation before deletion.
        Ensure the database exists before attempting deletion.
    Exit:
        Provide an option to exit the program gracefully.

Table Management (table.sh):

    Create Table:
        Allow users to define a table name and the number of columns.
        Prompt users to specify column names and their data types (e.g., Integer, String).
        Create a metadata file to store table structure.
    List Tables:
        Display all available tables in the connected database.
    Drop Table:
        Allow users to delete a table after confirmation.
    Insert Row:
        Validate and insert data into the table. Ensure primary keys are unique.
    Show Data:
        Display table data with an option to select all or specific columns.
    Delete Row:
        Allow users to delete specific rows based on a unique identifier.
    Update Cell:
        Enable users to update specific cells in the table by row and column numbers.
    Exit:
        Return control to the main menu (db.sh).

Bonus:
Offer extra credit for additional features like:
    Searching for data within a table.
    Exporting table data to a CSV file.
